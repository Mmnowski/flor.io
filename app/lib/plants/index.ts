/**
 * Plants Domain - Plant management operations
 *
 * Note: All plant operations are server-only and must be imported directly
 * from their specific modules to prevent server code from being bundled
 * into the client.
 *
 * Import directly from:
 * - './crud.server' (create, read, update, delete)
 * - './queries.server' (queries and calculations)
 * - './ai.server' (AI-specific operations)
